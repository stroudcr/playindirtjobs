# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

PlayInDirtJobs is a Next.js 15 job board for sustainable agriculture (farming, gardening, ranching). The app uses a no-authentication model where job management happens via magic links sent by email after Stripe payment.

**Key Technologies:**
- Next.js 15 (App Router) with TypeScript
- PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
- Stripe for payments
- Resend for emails
- TailwindCSS with custom solarpunk theme

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development server (runs on port 3000)
npm run dev

# Database operations
npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration_name>  # Create and run migration
npx prisma generate                              # Generate Prisma client
npx prisma studio                                # Open database GUI
npm run db:seed                                  # Seed database with sample data

# Build and production
npm run build                                     # Builds: prisma generate → prisma migrate deploy → next build
npm start                                         # Start production server

# Linting
npm run lint

# Stripe webhook forwarding (for local development)
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe-webhook
```

## Architecture

### Core Flow: Job Posting

1. **Job Creation** (`/post-job`): User fills form → proceeds to Stripe checkout
2. **Stripe Checkout** (`/api/create-checkout`): Creates Stripe session + inactive Job record with `editToken`
3. **Webhook** (`/api/stripe-webhook`): On `checkout.session.completed` → activates Job + sends email with magic link
4. **Management**: User receives email with `editToken` link to manage their job (future feature)

### Database Schema

Two main models in `prisma/schema.prisma`:

**Job**
- Slug-based URLs for SEO (`/jobs/[slug]`)
- `editToken` for passwordless management
- `featured` boolean for paid placement
- `active` boolean (only set after payment)
- Arrays for categories, jobType, farmType, benefits, tags
- 60-day expiration via `expiresAt`

**Subscriber**
- Email subscriptions for job alerts
- Category filtering support

### Key Data Structures

All constants defined in `lib/constants.ts`:
- `JOB_CATEGORIES`: 14 categories with emojis (farm-hand, gardener, ranch-hand, etc.)
- `JOB_TYPES`: full-time, part-time, seasonal, apprenticeship, etc.
- `FARM_TYPES`: organic, permaculture, regenerative, biodynamic, etc.
- `BENEFITS`: housing, meals, equipment, learning, etc.
- `PRICING`: Basic ($45), Featured ($95), Bundle ($199)

Validation schemas in `lib/validations.ts` using Zod.

### API Routes

- `POST /api/create-checkout`: Creates Stripe session + inactive Job record
- `POST /api/stripe-webhook`: Handles payment completion, activates jobs
- `GET /api/jobs`: Lists jobs with filtering/sorting
- `GET /api/jobs/[id]`: Individual job details
- `POST /api/subscribe`: Email subscription signup

### Email System

`lib/email.ts` uses Resend API:
- `sendJobConfirmationEmail()`: Sent after payment with magic link
- `sendJobAlertEmail()`: For subscriber notifications
- Configure `FROM_EMAIL` before production deployment

### Environment Variables

Required in `.env`:
```
DATABASE_URL              # PostgreSQL connection string
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY         # Stripe secret key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET     # From Stripe CLI or dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
RESEND_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL       # e.g., http://localhost:3000
BASIC_JOB_PRICE=4500      # In cents
FEATURED_JOB_PRICE=9500
```

See `.env.example` for full reference.

### Styling and Theme

Custom solarpunk color scheme in `tailwind.config.ts`:
- Primary green: `#10b981`
- Earth tones: browns, yellows, sky blue
- Nature-themed emojis throughout UI
- Custom CSS classes: `.btn`, `.card`, `.input` in `app/globals.css`

### Component Structure

**Page Components:**
- `/` - Homepage with job listings, filters, search
- `/post-job` - Job posting form with live preview
- `/jobs/[slug]` - Individual job detail page
- `/success` - Post-payment success page
- Category pages: `/farming-jobs`, `/gardening-jobs`, `/ranch-jobs`, etc.

**Reusable Components:**
- `JobCard` - Job listing card
- `FilterSidebar` / `MobileFilters` - Filtering UI
- `SearchBar` - Search functionality
- `LiveJobPreview` - Real-time preview in job posting form
- `PlanSelector` - Pricing plan selection
- `EmailSubscribe` - Newsletter signup

## Important Patterns

### Slug Generation
Jobs use slugified titles for URLs. Ensure unique slugs when creating jobs (append random string if needed).

### Magic Link Authentication
No traditional auth system. Job management URLs include `editToken` query param:
```
/manage/[editToken]
```
**Note:** Management UI is in TODO list and not yet implemented.

### Server vs Client Components
- Most pages are Server Components for SEO
- Forms and interactive UI use `"use client"` directive
- API routes handle all mutations

### Stripe Integration
- Use test mode keys in development
- Webhook signature verification is required
- Store `stripePaymentId` on Job for payment tracking
- Jobs remain inactive until webhook confirms payment

## Testing Stripe Locally

1. Install Stripe CLI: `brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe`
2. Login: `stripe login`
3. Forward webhooks: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe-webhook`
4. Copy webhook secret to `.env`
5. Test with card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`

## Known Limitations / TODOs

From README:
- Job management dashboard (edit/deactivate via magic link) - not yet implemented
- Advanced analytics for job posters
- Social sharing for job posts
- Map view for job locations
- Saved jobs for job seekers
- Company profiles
- Job application tracking

## Deployment

Recommended: Vercel
- Push to GitHub
- Import to Vercel
- Set all environment variables from `.env`
- Vercel auto-runs build command which includes Prisma migrations

Build process automatically runs:
1. `prisma generate`
2. `prisma migrate deploy`
3. `next build`
